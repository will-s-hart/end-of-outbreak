Data and Python code underlying: WS Hart et al., Optimising the timing of an 
end-of-outbreak declaration: Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

Code is compatible with Python version 3.12 (package dependencies are listed in the
'environment.yml' file, which can be used to create a `conda` virtual environment with
the required dependencies installed). Once the required dependencies have been
installed, the figures in the manuscript can be reproduced by running the 'main.py'
Python script in the 'src' directory (see the docstring at the beginning of that script
for detailed options).
